Based on the @training_recommendations , and @coach_input, create a realistic, week-by-week schedule for completing the recommended training. The schedule should: 1) Prioritize critical skill gaps first, 2) Account for a reasonable time commitment per week (assume the person is working full-time unless indicated otherwise in the CV or coach input), 3) Include milestones and checkpoints to track progress, 4) Span an appropriate timeframe based on the volume and complexity of training needed (typically 1-6 months), 5) Include specific actions and goals for each week. The schedule should be realistic and achievable, considering the candidate's current skill level as indicated in their CV.
