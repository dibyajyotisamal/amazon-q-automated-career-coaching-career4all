Based on the @skill_gap_analysis, @candidate_CV, @job_description, and @coach_input, recommend specific training resources, courses, certifications, or learning paths to help the candidate bridge the identified skill gaps. For each recommendation, include: 1) The specific skill gap it addresses, 2) Why this training is appropriate for the candidate's background, 3) Estimated time commitment required, 4) Whether it's free or paid (with approximate cost if paid), 5) Links or names of specific resources where possible (online courses, books, certifications, etc.). Prioritize recommendations based on the importance of the skill gaps they address.
